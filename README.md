## Abstract
The microservice pattern serves as an excellent practice in building modern applications to be more resilient and reduce dependencies across the multiple parts of a product. But generally, these involve complex web frameworks and containerization to get those benefits. But using Azure Functions, we can develop more concise services even quicker and get many of the benefits of serverless technology without lots of operational management. In this session, weâ€™ll explore Azure Functions and see how they can be used to build out a microservice-based solution.
