![Building Event-Driven Microservices](Thumbnail.jpg)

## Abstract
Event-driven architecture promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. Using this type of architecture can improve how your products respond to events coming in from multiple sources – especially when you need to take various actions based upon an event. During this session, we’ll explore event-driven architecture and how we can incorporate it into a microservice pattern to develop lightweight services that can quickly react to events coming from multiple sources. While the architecture can work with different technologies, we’ll implement this approach using Azure services.
